            <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Born into a small German coal mining town in the winter of ‘85. Grandson to the owner of Erb’s Tomboy Market, a small local grocery store owned by Clifford & Betty Erb and grandson to Edward Hearell.  
                    Eventually moving to the Bentonville Arkansas area in 1989 for a short time before eventually settling down in Ogden Utah. It was in Ogden where an interest in all things trains began to develop. 
                    The almost weekly visits to the Union Pacific station, and their many displays of model railroad were fascinating. An unexpected trip to Boston Mass. 
                    Provided a good lesson into the family history within the Americas, particularly to the family ties to Dr. Joseph Warren, a General during the Revolutionary War.
                </p>
                <p>This new found interest in history and a mindset of where we will go next, television shows such as SeaQuest and movies such as Star Wars, helped shape the passion of space exploration.
                    Throughout the primary and secondary years, Cody found quite a few inspirations along the way. There were the typical Neil A. Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, but also some teachers, 
                    good and bad. Some didn’t believe and others who instilled the mindset that the sky is not the limit.

            <h2>High School Years</h2>
            <p>Cody attended Marissa Jr./Sr. High school in Marissa Illinois. While attending, he met those that would eventually become mentors and inspiration. In this school, the first person to give a push
                in the right direction would be a Science Teacher Leon Spinka. Mr. Spinka would always take the time to encourage his students to look outside the box. It was with the help
                of Science Sleuths which was a series of interactive video published first to LaserDisc that provided the foundation of this way of thiniking outside the box.
