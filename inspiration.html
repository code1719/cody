            Neil Armstrong was a NASA astronaut and aeronautical engineer. He
            famously became the first person to walk on the moon on July 20,
            1969 during Apollo 11. Armstrong also flew on NASA's Gemini 8
            mission in 1966. He retired from NASA in 1971 and remained active in
            the aerospace community, although he chose to keep mostly out of the
            public spotlight. Armstrong died August 25, 2012.

            Fascinated by steam engine trains at an early age, Mr. Lewis held a
            Master's Degree in Mathematics from Southern Illinois University and
            a Master's Degree in CHemistry from the University of Arizona. He
            was a teacher for 54 years in public schools. 10 years at Trico High
            School and 42 years at Marissa High School. He also spent 25 years
            as an adjunct chemistry instructor at Southwestern Illinois College.
            While at Marissa High School, he was involved with several space
            projects for NASA, as a Christa McAuliffe fellow.

            Born in St. Louis Mo., James did not end up too far away in the
            small town of Marissa Illinois. There he was one of the few teachers
            in Mathematics. His alternative way to thinking not only inspired,
            but reassured his students that it's ok to not remember everything
            all the time.

          <h3>Dr. Joseph Warren 1741-1775</h3>
          <img
            class="insp-img"
            src="/img/JosephWarren.jpeg"
            alt="Joseph Warren"
          />
          <p>
            Joseph Warren was born in Roxbury, MA on June 11, 1741, the eldest
            of four sons of Joseph Warren, a farmer, who died after falling out
            of an apple tree. Joseph, Jr. would attend Harvard, teach briefly at
            the Latin School and then study to be a physician. He married
            Elizabeth Hooten in 1764.<br /><br />
            Dr. Warren began his participation in the radical cause in 1767,
            with the passage of the Townsend Acts. Warren's response was a
            series of articles in the Boston Gazette under a pseudonym "A True
            Patriot". These articles so angered the royal governor that he
            attempted to charge Warren and the publishers of the newspaper with
            libel, but the grand jury refused to bring forth a true bill.<br /><br />
            After the publishing of the articles, Warren’s star began to rise in
            the radical circles. His friendship with Samuel Adams as well as
            family ties with James Otis (his brother-in-law) and Masonic
            connection with Paul Revere and other rebel luminaries would put him
            in the thick of the separatist movement. Warren would become
            chairman of the Committee of Safety after the “Boston Massacre” of
            1770 and would deliver two of the famous orations on the
            anniversaries of that event.<br /><br />
            While Samuel Adams was away in Philadelphia in 1774, attending to
            the business of the Continental Congress, Joseph Warren assumed
            Adam’s leadership role in Boston and became involved with the
            raising of militias and procurement of arms and powder. A few months
            later Adams and John Hancock would return to Massachusetts to find
            the Crown had placed a price on their heads. It was Joseph Warren,
            who would direct Paul Revere and William Dawes to warn the two
            leaders that British soldiers were heading toward their sanctuary in
            Lexington, MA to arrest them on 18 April, 1775.<br /><br />
            The news of the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord would cause
            Warren to leave his patients in the care of his assistant, William
            Eustis and ride toward the scene of battle. He would spend the next
            six weeks readying the militia for the inevitable battles to come.
            For his efforts, he was elected second general in command of the
            Massachusetts forces by the Provincial congress on 14 June, 1775.<br /><br />
            After meeting with the committee of safety at General Artemas Ward’s
            headquarters on Cambridge common on the morning of 17 June, Warren
            learned that British forces had landed at Charlestown. About noon,
            he rode over to the American fortifications on Breed’s Hill.
            <strong>The rest is the stuff of legends:</strong
            ><i
              >Warren refused to take command, instead going into the line as a
              regular volunteer. On the third and final British assault near the
              redoubt, while attempting to rally the militia, Warren was
              instantly killed by a ball between the eyes. The men that Warren
              had rallied in those last moments were a spectrum of Massachusetts
              society: merchants, farmers, mechanics, laborers; white men, black
              men, both slave and free and indigenous people; all fighting for
              their freedom. How ironic that the leader was a slave owner.</i

          Joseph Warren became an instant hero. His death was immortalized in
          John Trumbull’s painting; “The Death of General Warren” King Solomon’s
          Lodge honored their Grand Master with the first Bunker Hill Monument,
          which now resides in the base of the present monument. In New England,
          every state has a town named in his honor. In death he was a hero, his
          life cut tragically short, and his potential unknown.
